# The Mill Adventure - FE Test by Fernando Cellini

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

## Prerequisites

This project requires Node.js version `20.11.1 (LTS)`. It is recommended to use NVM (Node Version Manager) to manage and switch between Node.js versions easily.

### Using NVM to Set Node.js Version

Follow these steps to install NVM and use it to set the Node.js version for this project:

1. **Install NVM**: Follow the instructions to install NVM from the [official NVM GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

2. **Navigate to This Project's Folder**: Open a terminal and change to the directory where this project is located.

3. **Set Node.js Version with NVM**: Run the following command in the terminal to switch to the required Node.js version for this project.

   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

If the specified version of Node.js is not already installed, NVM will prompt you to install it. You can do so by running `nvm install 20.11.1`.

For more information about NVM and its commands, visit the [NVM GitHub page](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

4. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command in the terminal to download all the required dependencies for this project.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
